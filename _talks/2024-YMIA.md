In October 2024, I gave a talk titled **"Prompt Engineering: How to Generate Good and Functional Code with the BioImage.IO Chatbot"** at the [YMIA Python Event](https://gerbi-gmb.de/teams/ymia/), an initiative to support early-career imaging scientists.

This session introduced attendees to prompt engineering techniques for generative AI tools, focusing on how to use the **BioImage.IO Chatbot** to:

- 🧠 Write clear and effective prompts  
- 🧪 Generate functional Python code for bioimage analysis tasks  
- 🔄 Iterate and debug collaboratively with the chatbot  
- ⚙️ Integrate AI-driven coding into research workflows  

The session was co-led with **Dr. Claudia Salat Canela**, active contributor in the [image.sc](https://forum.image.sc) community.
