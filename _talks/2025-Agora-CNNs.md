In April 2025, together with my master students **Claudia Castrillón-Álvarez** and **Laura Rodrigo-Muñoz**, I delivered a session titled **"Lecture & Practical Session on Advanced CNNs"** at the **Ágora** Journal Club organized by the Signal Theory and Communications Department at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

The session included:

- 📊 **30-minute theory talk** on:
  - CNN building blocks (convolutions, pooling, activations, batch norm)
  - Architectures: ResNet, U-Net, YOLO
  - Transfer learning and fine-tuning
  - Evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1, mAP, Dice, IoU)

- 🧪 **Hands-on Jupyter Notebook** covering:
  - Classification with custom CNNs and pretrained ResNet
  - Object detection with YOLOv8
  - Segmentation with U-Net and MONAI UNet
  - Tailored loss functions and evaluation strategies

🧠 **Datasets Used**:
- Brain Cancer - MRI Dataset (Kaggle)
- Brain Tumor Detection Dataset (Ultralytics)
- Pancreatic Stem Cells Dataset (Cell Tracking Challenge)

📁 **Materials**: [Zenodo (10.5281/zenodo.15276042)](https://zenodo.org/records/15276042)

This session aimed to give students an integrated perspective on how CNNs are used across classification, detectio
