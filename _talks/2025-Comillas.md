In February 2025, I was invited to speak at the **Biosignals** course at **Universidad Pontificia Comillas**, where I presented a talk titled **"ECG and PPG Applications in Healthcare"**.

The session focused on:

- 🫀 My research on **ECG-based biometric identification**
- 🔍 Adapting the method for **atrial fibrillation (AFib) detection**
- 🧠 Using deep learning with **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**
- 🖼️ Visual representation of ECG signals as **electrocardiomaps (ECMs)** or heatmaps
- 🔐 Exploring the potential of these methods for **health monitoring and security applications**

The talk highlighted how a methodology originally designed for secure patient identification was repurposed to detect cardiac pathologies, showing the versatility and robustness of ECG-based approaches in personalized healthcare.
