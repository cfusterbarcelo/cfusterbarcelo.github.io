In May 2025, I participated in the [EPFL Open Microscopy & AI Workshop](https://www.epfl-open-microscopy.com), where I gave a presentation and led a hands-on workshop on **Deep Learning for Bioimage Analysis**, aligned with the [AI4Life](https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu/) initiative.

The session included:

- Presentation on AI workflows in microscopy following the AI4Life approach
- Hands-on guide using **deepImageJ** for image segmentation
- Interactive image annotation with **SAMJ**, powered by the Segment Anything Model
- Practical tools and strategies for deploying DL models in ImageJ/Fiji

📁 **Slides & Materials**: [Zenodo (10.5281/zenodo.15023685)](https://zenodo.org/records/15023685)  
💻 **GitHub Repository**: [Workshop Materials – EPFL 2025](https://github.com/deepimagej/Workshop-materials/tree/main/OpenMicroscopyEPFL-2025)

This workshop aimed to equip researchers with accessible tools and workflows to bridge the gap between AI model development and real-world application in the life sciences.
