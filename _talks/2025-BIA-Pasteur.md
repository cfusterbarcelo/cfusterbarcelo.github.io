In May 2025, I delivered a session titled **"AI-Based Pipelines for Bioimage Analysis"** at the [NEUBIAS Bioimage Analysis Course](https://france-bioimaging.org/announcement/neubias-pasteur-course-on-bioimage-analysis-2025/) hosted at [Institut Pasteur](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/course/neubias-network-of-european-bioimage-analysts/), Paris. This course is part of the prestigious NEUBIAS training series, focused on advancing bioimage analysis across Europe.

My talk introduced participants to deep learning concepts and tools tailored for microscopy workflows, including:

- When and why to apply deep learning in microscopy
- The lifecycle of a deep learning model
- Transformer architectures and Vision Transformers (ViTs)
- Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its integration into Fiji via **SAMJ**
- Practical use of tools such as **deepImageJ**, **BiaPy**, and **BioImage.IO**

We also conducted hands-on exercises using [SAMJ](https://github.com/segment-anything-models-java/SAMJ) to annotate biological images efficiently, supported by curated datasets and workflows.
