## AI4Life Hackathon and Solvathon

In October 2023, I joined the **AI4Life Hackathon and Solvathon**, held at [EMBL Heidelberg](https://www.embl.org/sites/heidelberg/) in Germany. This joint event focused on identifying challenges in deploying AI models in life sciences and collaboratively solving them through hands-on development and cross-disciplinary discussions.

This initiative, organized by [AI4Life](https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu), aimed to bridge the gap between AI developers and bioimage analysts, encouraging community-driven solutions and enhancing model accessibility across infrastructures.
