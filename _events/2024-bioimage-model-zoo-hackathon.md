## BioImage Model Zoo Enhancements Hackathon

In March 2024, I participated in the **BioImage Model Zoo Enhancements Hackathon** at [EMBL Heidelberg](https://www.embl.org/sites/heidelberg/), focused on improving the BioImage Model Zoo ecosystem.

We worked on reworking and expanding the [Bioimage.io](https://bioimage.io) documentation and implemented new features to improve user experience and developer contribution workflows.
