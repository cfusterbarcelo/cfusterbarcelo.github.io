## Effectively Communicating Bioimage Analysis Workshop

In February 2024, I participated in the [**Effectively Communicating Bioimage Analysis Workshop**](https://www.biologists.com/workshops/february-2024/) held in East Sussex, UK.

I contributed to the event by presenting a poster abstract on **deepImageJ**, discussing its relevance in reproducible and accessible deep learning workflows for microscopy image analysis.

The workshop brought together experts in scientific communication and microscopy to exchange ideas on improving how bioimage analysis is taught, published, and applied across disciplines.

### Highlights
- Shared experience and tools from the deepImageJ ecosystem.
- Focused on bridging communication gaps between tool developers and life scientists.
- Hosted by The Company of Biologists at a dedicated workshop facility in East Sussex.
