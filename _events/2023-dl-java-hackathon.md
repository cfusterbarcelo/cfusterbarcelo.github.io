## Accessibility of DL Models from Java Hackathon

In February 2023, I participated in the **Accessibility of Deep Learning Models from Java Hackathon** hosted at the [Human Technopole](https://humantechnopole.it/en/) in Milan, Italy. This event brought together developers and researchers to explore how deep learning models can be made accessible and interoperable from Java environments.

The hackathon was organized as part of the [AI4Life](https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu) project and focused on integrating state-of-the-art deep learning tools into platforms like ImageJ/Fiji, used widely in life science research.

### Highlights
- Collaborative development of tools to bridge Python-trained models with Java ecosystems.
- Focus on reproducibility and accessibility in microscopy workflows.
- Hands-on integration of deep learning models with BioImage.IO and ImageJ/Fiji.
