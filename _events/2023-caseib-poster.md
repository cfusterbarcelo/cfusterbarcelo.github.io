## CASEIB 2023 — Conference Presentation

At the [CASEIB 2023](https://caseib.es/2023/) conference held in Cartagena, I presented a **poster** based on the Bachelor Thesis project by Gloria (listed in the [Teaching](/teaching/) section).

The work focused on **automatic estimation of Endolymphatic Hydrops Ratios in Ménière’s disease**, using MRI-based computational pipelines developed in collaboration with Clínica Universidad de Navarra.

### Highlights
- 📍 Poster presentation at Spain’s national biomedical engineering conference.
- 👩‍🎓 Based on a student Bachelor Thesis.
- 🧠 Contributions to reproducible image analysis and inner ear diagnosis support tools.
