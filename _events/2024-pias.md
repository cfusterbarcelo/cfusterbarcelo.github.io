## Precarity and Instability in Academia Symposium (PIAS)

On December 13, 2024, I co-organized the [**Precarity and Instability in Academia Symposium (PIAS)**](https://pias.cc/2024/) alongside [José Miguel Moreno (UC3M)](https://cosec.inf.uc3m.es/people/jose-miguel-moreno/).

This interdisciplinary conference focused on the structural challenges and inequalities within academic careers, including precarious employment, career uncertainty, and mental health impacts.

### Highlights
- Brought together early-career researchers, policy makers, and academics from across disciplines.
- Included talks, panels, and paper presentations on working conditions, funding systems, and institutional practices.
- Facilitated open conversations and advocacy toward more equitable academic futures.

More information and proceedings can be found on the [official website](https://pias.cc/2024/).
