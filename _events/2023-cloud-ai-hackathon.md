## Cloud Based and AI Hackathon

In June 2023, I participated in the **Hackathon on Web and Cloud Infrastructure for AI-Powered BioImage Analysis**, hosted at [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se) in Stockholm, Sweden. The event was part of the [AI4Life](https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu) project and focused on building and optimizing cloud-based platforms to deploy and run deep learning models for microscopy and biomedical image analysis.

The hackathon brought together engineers, researchers, and infrastructure experts to address key challenges in bioimage analysis workflows powered by AI, with an emphasis on reproducibility, interoperability, and scalability.
