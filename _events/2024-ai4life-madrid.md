## AI4Life Workshop-Hackathon-Uploathon (Madrid)

In June 2024, I co-organized the [**AI4Life Workshop-Hackathon-Uploathon**](https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu/event/workshop-hackathon-uploathon-madrid/) in Madrid alongside with Prof. Arrate Muñoz-Barrutia.

The event aimed to bring together researchers and developers from the bioimage analysis community to:
- **Workshops**: share hands-on training for reproducible AI workflows in microscopy.
- **Hackathon**: collaboratively develop and improve bioimage tools and infrastructure.
- **Uploathon**: help researchers prepare and submit models to BioImage.io.

### Highlights
- Bridged training, tool development, and dissemination in a single event.
- Promoted FAIR principles and community contributions to model sharing platforms.
- Resulted in active tool improvements and open discussions around reproducibility in bioimaging.
