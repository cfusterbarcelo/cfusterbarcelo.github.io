## PyConES 2022 — Conference Talk and Participation

At [PyConES 2022](https://2022.es.pycon.org), held in Granada, I presented a talk on my **PhD thesis research** in the context of Python for bioimage analysis. I also actively participated in the full conference program, engaging with the Spanish Python community.

### Highlights
- 🎤 Gave a talk on **deep learning and image analysis pipelines** from my PhD work.
- 👥 Participated throughout the event, sharing and learning in Python Spain's largest developer community.
- 🐍 Strengthened connections with open-source and scientific computing communities in Spain.
