This Master Thesis represents the first stage in a comprehensive pipeline for the automatic diagnosis of **Ménière’s Disease** from MRI. The focus was on the **automated classification and localization** of inner ear structures using two high-resolution imaging modalities: 3D-SPACE-MRC and 3D-REAL-IR MRI.

The system included:
- A custom Convolutional Neural Network to classify relevant MRI slices containing ear structures
- A YOLO-based object detection model to localize cochlear and vestibular regions

### 🧪 Highlights
- Classification model achieved 97.74% accuracy with low validation loss  
- Object detector delivered strong performance in mAP@0.5 and mAP@[0.5:0.95]  
- Dataset: MRI volumes from 90 patients, labeled in collaboration with radiologists  
- The pipeline is designed for clinical integration into Siemens MRI systems

This work laid the foundation for the segmentation and volumetric analysis carried out in the paired thesis project.
