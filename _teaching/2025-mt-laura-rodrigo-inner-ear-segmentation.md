This Master Thesis presents a **deep learning-based segmentation pipeline** for the automated quantification of **Endolymphatic Hydrops (EH)** in patients with **Ménière’s Disease**, using high-resolution MRI scans. The goal was to compute the Endolymphatic Ratio (ELR) reliably, minimizing the need for manual segmentation by radiologists.

Using optimized 3D U-Net architectures, the system successfully segmented:
- Vestibular cavities
- Vestibular endolymph regions

These volumes were then used to automatically calculate the ELR. Various architectural enhancements and tuning strategies were explored to maximize generalization and performance.

### 🧪 Highlights
- Evaluation metrics included Dice Similarity Coefficient and Sensitivity  
- Achieved high segmentation accuracy with reproducible ELR estimation  
- Built for full automation of current manual workflows in clinical diagnosis  
- This thesis complements a related project focused on classification and localization

Together, both theses create a complete deep learning pipeline for EH diagnosis support, contributing to faster and more consistent patient evaluation.
