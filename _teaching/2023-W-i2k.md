In our workshop at [I2K 2023](https://www.i2kconference.org/workshops), titled 'Leveraging Cloud-Based Virtual Desktops for Bioimage Analysis with BAND and DeepImageJ,' participants had the opportunity to dive into the world of cloud-based virtual desktops and explore cutting-edge tools for bioimage analysis. The session commenced with an insightful platform overview, shedding light on the capabilities and potential applications. We also delved into practical demonstrations, showcasing the power of DeepImageJ for in-depth image analysis directly within the platform. This workshop, conducted by Caterina Fuster-Barceló and Yi Sun, offered a hands-on experience with [BAND](https://band.embl.de/#/eosc-landingpage) desktop, where participants had the chance to interact with the [BioImage Model Zoo](https://bioimage.io) and [deepImageJ](https://deepimagej.github.io). It was a valuable opportunity to explore the fusion of cloud computing and bioimage analysis, providing insights into the latest advancements in this dynamic field.
