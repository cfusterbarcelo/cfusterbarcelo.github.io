During the 2024/2025 academic year, I participated as a mentor in UC3M’s *Among Coursemates* program — an initiative aimed at improving peer-to-peer support and easing academic transitions within the Bachelor's programs.

In this role, I tutored 4 second-year students from Biomedical Engineering who were, in turn, mentoring first-year students. This “mentoring the mentors” experience was incredibly enriching: I supported them as they navigated their own academic doubts, workload pressures, and the responsibility of guiding younger peers.

It was inspiring to see their motivation and resilience as they took on the challenge of supporting others while still growing as students themselves.

### 🌟 Reflections

- Built confidence in communication and leadership for the mentees
- Contributed to a stronger, more collaborative learning environment within the department
