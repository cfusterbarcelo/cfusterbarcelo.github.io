During the summer of 2024, I mentored two undergraduate students from U.S. universities as part of the international research program hosted by the **C3IS Research Labs** at UC3M. The students joined the **Bioengineering Lab** for a full-time, immersive research experience in biomedical image analysis.

Throughout the 8-week program, I guided their hands-on training in:
- Deep learning models for bioimage segmentation
- Use of Fiji/ImageJ, deepImageJ, and Python-based workflows
- Data curation and preprocessing in real imaging datasets

### 🌟 Highlights
- Helped the students navigate research for the first time in an international setting
- Designed a mini-project workflow tailored to their background and goals
- Encouraged independent exploration while supporting their technical growth

This experience was not only rewarding from a scientific perspective, but also a culturally enriching opportunity to foster global collaboration in research.
