## Who I am
As an accomplished post-doctoral researcher, I am proud to be part of [AI4Life](https://www.eu-openscreen.eu/projects/ai4life.html), an ambitious project under the Horizon Europe Work Program that unites 10 leading partners from 8 countries in a comprehensive 3-year, 4 million EUR effort. Working closely with my supervisor, [Dr. Arrate Muñoz Barrutia](https://image.hggm.es/es/arrate-munoz), who has made big strides in the field of AI and Microscopy.

I recently defended my PhD in Computer Science and Technology, earned at the prestigious Carlos III University of Madrid (UC3M) under the guidance of [Dr. Pedro Peris](https://lightweightcryptography.com) and [Dr. Carmen Cámara](https://carmen-camara.com). With a strong academic foundation, including a B.Sc. in Telematics Engineering from the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB) and a M.Sc. in Cybersecurity from UC3M, I am well-equipped to tackle the challenges of AI.

In addition to my research, I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and expertise with a diverse range of communities, which is why I participate in [Skype A Scientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com) and have presented my groundbreaking thesis at numerous conferences to audiences from various backgrounds.
