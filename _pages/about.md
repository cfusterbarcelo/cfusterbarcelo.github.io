## Who I am
I am a post-doctoral researcher inmersed in [AI4Life](https://www.eu-openscreen.eu/projects/ai4life.html), a project from the Horizon Europe Work Program that brings together 10 partners from 8 countries into a 4 million EUR effort for 3 years. My actual supervisor whom I work with for this amazing project is [Dra. Arrate Muñoz Barrutia](https://image.hggm.es/es/arrate-munoz). In December 2022 I defended a PhD in Computer Science and Technology obtained at Carlos III University of Madrid (UC3M), Spain under the supervision of [Dr. Pedro Peris](https://lightweightcryptography.com) and [Dr. Carmen Cámara](https://carmen-camara.com). I possess a B.Sc. in Telematics Engineering in the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB) and a M.Sc. in Cybersecurity for the UC3M. One of my great passions is sharing the knowdledge I obtained this last years with different communities. For this reason, I am participating in [Skype A Scientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com) and I have explained my thesis for people from different backgrounds in different conferences that you will find in the Talks Section!

## Research
My main interests are:
- Biometrics
