## Who I am
Hello, I'm Caterina!

I am a Post-doctoral researcher at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M) in the [BSEL](https://www.uc3m.es/ss/Satellite/GruposInvestigacion/es/Detalle/Organismo_C/1371353731440/1371325143833/BSEL_-_Laboratorio_de_Ciencia_e_Ingenieria_Biomedica) group. I work closely with my supervisor, Dra. Arrate Muñoz Barrutia, exploring the exciting field of biomedical science and engineering.

Currently, I am actively involved in the [AI4Life project](https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu), a groundbreaking initiative supported by the Horizon Europe Work Program. This ambitious project brings together 10 leading partners from 8 countries, with a dedicated 3-year, 4 million EUR investment. Through this project, we aim to advance the frontiers of artificial intelligence in the realm of life sciences.

In addition to my work on AI4Life, I am also passionate about various projects in the field of bioimage analysis. I specialize in areas such as microscopy, histopathology, and magnetic resonances.

Last year, I successfully defended my PhD thesis, receiving a cum laude mention. My research focused on the intersection of cybersecurity and biometrics. Specifically, I explored the identification of individuals using their own Electrocardiogram signals transformed into images.

Through my website, I aim to share my expertise, experiences, and discoveries with the broader scientific community. Join me on this exciting journey as we explore the frontiers of biomedical research.

Feel free to reach out, collaborate, or explore more about my work and interests.
