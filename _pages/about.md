## Who I am
I am a post-doctoral researcher inmersed in , a project from the Horizon Europe Work Program that brings together 10 partners from 8 countries into a 4 million EUR effort for 3 years. My actual supervisor whom I work with for this amazing project is [Dra. Arrate Muñoz Barrutia](https://image.hggm.es/es/arrate-munoz). In December 2022 I defended a PhD in Computer Science and Technology obtained at Carlos III University of Madrid (UC3M), Spain under the supervision of [Dr. Pedro Peris](https://lightweightcryptography.com) and [Dr. Carmen Cámara](https://carmen-camara.com). I possess a B.Sc. in Telematics Engineering in the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB) and a M.Sc. in Cybersecurity for the UC3M.  I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and expertise with a wide range of communities, which is why I participate in [Skype A Scientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com) and have presented my thesis to audiences of diverse backgrounds at various conferences. You can find more information about my work and accomplishments on my Talks Section!

As a highly accomplished post-doctoral researcher, I am proud to be part of [AI4Life](https://www.eu-openscreen.eu/projects/ai4life.html), an ambitious project under the Horizon Europe Work Program that unites 10 leading partners from 8 countries in a comprehensive 3-year, 4 million EUR effort. Working closely with my supervisor, [Dr. Arrate Muñoz Barrutia](https://image.hggm.es/es/arrate-munoz), I have made tremendous strides in the field of AI.

I recently defended my PhD in Computer Science and Technology, earned at the prestigious Carlos III University of Madrid (UC3M) under the guidance of [Dr. Pedro Peris](https://lightweightcryptography.com) and [Dr. Carmen Cámara](https://carmen-camara.com). With a strong academic foundation, including a B.Sc. in Telematics Engineering from the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB) and a M.Sc. in Cybersecurity from UC3M, I am well-equipped to tackle the challenges of AI.

In addition to my research, I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and expertise with a diverse range of communities, which is why I participate in [Skype A Scientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com) and have presented my groundbreaking thesis at numerous conferences to audiences from various backgrounds.
