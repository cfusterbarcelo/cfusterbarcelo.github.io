## Who I am
I am a PhD Candidate in Computer Science and Technology working at the Computer Security Lab (COSEC) at Carlos III University of Madrid (UC3M), Spain under the supervision of [Dr. Pedro Peris](https://lightweightcryptography.com) and [Dr. Carmen Cámara](https://carmen-camara.com). I have a B.Sc. in Telematics Engineering in the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB) and a M.Sc. in Cybersecurity for the UC3M. My area of expertise is biometric identification together with Deep Learning analysis. Consequently, my current work is focused in developing a biometrical identification method based on Electrocardiograms (ECG) and based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as the classification method.
In addition, I am also participating in [Skype A Scientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com).

## Research
My main interests are:
- Biometric identification
- Deep Learning
- Computer Vision
- Coffee with soy milk
