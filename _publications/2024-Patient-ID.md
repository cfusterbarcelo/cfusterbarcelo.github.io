### 🧠 Abstract

Over the course of the past two decades, a substantial body of research has substantiated the viability of utilising cardiac signals as a biometric modality. This paper presents a novel approach for patient identification in healthcare systems using electrocardiogram signals. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to classify users based on electrocardiomatrices, a specific type of image derived from ECG signals.

The system is rigorously evaluated across multiple datasets and scenarios:
- **Healthy subjects**: 99.84% accuracy  
- **Patients with cardiovascular diseases**: 97.09% accuracy  
- **Mixed populations (healthy + arrhythmic)**: 97.89%  
- **Physical activity variation**: 91.32% accuracy  

With an exceptionally low **False Acceptance Rate (FAR)** of 0.01% and **False Rejection Rate (FRR)** of 0.157%, this approach sets a new benchmark for robust and practical biometric identification systems in clinical contexts.
