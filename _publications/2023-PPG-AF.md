## Unveiling Hidden Patterns: Harnessing the Power of Short PPG-Traces for Atrial Fibrillation Detection

### 🔍 Summary

This study explores atrial fibrillation (AF) detection through short **photoplethysmography (PPG)** traces by drawing analogies with:
- Cardiologists’ acoustic evaluation of cardiac rhythms
- Musical signal analysis (pitch, timbre, and scalograms)

Using musical features extracted from PPG signals, the work compares:
- A **handcrafted feature approach** reaching 89% accuracy
- A **CNN + CBAM attention module** achieving up to 95% accuracy

### 💡 Significance

- Shows that **shortened PPG recordings** (instead of ECG) are **sufficient and reliable** for AF detection.
- Competitive with FDA-approved ECG-based solutions, but **simpler, faster, and cheaper**.
- Demonstrates the **universal potential** of music-inspired signal interpretation in biomedical sensing.
