**SAMJ** is a plugin that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into the Fiji/ImageJ ecosystem, enabling efficient, user-friendly, and high-quality image annotation for biological imaging tasks.

This tool eliminates IT barriers through one-click installation and Java-Python integration (via Appose), supporting real-time segmentation with SAM variants (like SAM-2, EfficientSAM, and EfficientViTSAM) even on standard computers.

Key features include:
- Seamless integration with Fiji tools and macros
- Live and batch annotation modes
- Compatibility with BigDataViewer and Labkit for 3D/multi-label annotation
- Interactive prompt-based segmentation
- Application in various use cases (e.g., nuclei segmentation, tumor quantification, 3D EM)

The work lowers the entry barrier for AI-based bioimage analysis and contributes to more accessible and scalable annotation pipelines for the life sciences.
