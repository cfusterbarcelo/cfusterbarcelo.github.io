### 🔍 Summary

This *Perspective* article highlights the indispensable contributions of **bioimage analysts (BIAs)** to modern life sciences. Drawing from a Company of Biologists Workshop, the paper outlines the current landscape of BIA work, existing roadblocks, and practical strategies to:

- Gain **recognition and credit** for BIA contributions  
- Improve **training and career development** paths  
- Increase **collaborative efforts and funding**  
- Enhance **standardization and reproducibility** in microscopy workflows
