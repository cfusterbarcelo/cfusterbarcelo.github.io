**Bridging the Gap: Integrating Cutting-edge Techniques into Biological Imaging with deepImageJ**

This work presents the latest developments in **deepImageJ**, a powerful and user-friendly **Fiji/ImageJ plugin** that enables researchers to apply **state-of-the-art deep learning models** for biological image analysis without writing code.

### 🔍 Highlights:
- **Multi-framework support** through the **Java Deep Learning Library (JDLL)**, enabling the execution of **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **ONNX** models within one environment.
- Seamless handling of **3D image data**, **large-scale images**, and **multi-model pipelines**.
- Real-world **case studies** that illustrate:
  1. Integrated image-to-image translation + nuclei segmentation  
  2. 3D nuclei segmentation workflows  
  3. Large image segmentation performance

### 💡 Why it matters:
By lowering the entry barrier for applying AI in microscopy, **deepImageJ** empowers **life scientists, clinicians, and analysts** to integrate AI into their workflows—no engineering background required. This bridges a critical gap between **deep learning model developers** and **experimental researchers**, fostering broader interdisciplinary collaboration.
