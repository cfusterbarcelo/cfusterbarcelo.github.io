## DL4MicEverywhere: Deep Learning for Microscopy Made Flexible, Shareable, and Reproducible

**Journal**: [Nature Methods (Vol. 21, June 2024, Pages 925–927)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02295-6)  
**Preprint**: [bioRxiv version](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.19.567606v1)  
**Code Repository**: [github.com/HenriquesLab/DL4MicEverywhere](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/DL4MicEverywhere)

### 🚀 Summary

**DL4MicEverywhere** expands upon ZeroCostDL4Mic, making deep learning methods for microscopy:
- **More flexible**: usable across diverse environments via Dockerized Jupyter Notebooks
- **More shareable**: enabling collaboration with reproducible containers
- **More reproducible**: thanks to standardized interactive pipelines

---

### 🔬 Why it matters

Many researchers lack the infrastructure or skills to deploy advanced deep learning models. **DL4MicEverywhere** solves this by bundling tools and code inside portable environments, allowing scientists to run training and inference with minimal configuration.

The platform:
- Doubles the number of techniques originally offered by ZeroCostDL4Mic
- Encourages community contributions through automated CI pipelines
- Enables faster onboarding and experimentation in bioimage analysis

This democratizes AI access for experimentalists, educators, and developers alike.
