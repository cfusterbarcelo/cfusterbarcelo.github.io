**ELEKTRA: ELEKTRokardiomatrix Application to Biometric Identification with Convolutional Neural Networks**

Biometric systems are becoming an increasingly common identification method in everyday life. We introduce a novel approach using Elektrokardiogramms (ECGs), transformed into heatmaps of aligned R-peaks (heartbeats), creating a matrix we call an *Elektrokardiomatrix (EKM)*.

Our method uses a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) — just one convolutional layer and pooling — to identify users with outstanding accuracy. Evaluated on three datasets (NSRDB, MIT-BIH, and PTB), we achieved:
- **99.53% accuracy** (NSRDB)
- **0.02% FAR**, **0.05% FRR**

This lightweight solution delivers **high performance with low computational cost**. It shows strong potential as a secure and efficient biometric identification system.
