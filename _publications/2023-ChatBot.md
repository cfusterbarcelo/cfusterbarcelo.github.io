**BioImage.IO Chatbot: A Personalized Assistant for BioImage Analysis Augmented by Community Knowledge Base**

The rapidly expanding landscape of **bioimage analysis tools** presents a navigational challenge for both experts and newcomers. Traditional search methods often fall short in supporting users through this complexity.

To address this, we introduce the **BioImage.IO Chatbot** — an **AI-driven conversational assistant** tailored for the bioimage community. Built on top of **large language models**, the chatbot provides **personalized, context-aware answers** by aggregating and interpreting knowledge from:

- Tool-specific documentation  
- Community databases  
- Structured and curated resources

Enriched by a **community-driven knowledge base** and advanced retrieval strategies, the chatbot enables:

- Personalized interaction
- Enhanced interpretability
- Greater accessibility to complex analysis tools

It transforms how biologists, analysts, and developers navigate the world of computational imaging.
