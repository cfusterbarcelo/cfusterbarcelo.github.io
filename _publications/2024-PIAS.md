## Can You Afford to Research? The Financial Strain of Ph.D. Students in Spain

**Published in**: [Proceedings of the Precarity and Instability in Academia Symposium (PIAS)](https://pias.cc)  
**Authors**: Caterina Fuster-Barceló, Alejandro Guerrero-López  

### Abstract

This study examines the financial challenges affecting the decline in Ph.D. candidates and completions in Spain, focusing on national scholarship schemes (such as FPU and PIF) and increasing living costs. Using recent government data, we compare these scholarships to average salaries, inflation trends, and housing affordability.

We find that current scholarship amounts are substantially lower than national income averages and often fail to cover basic housing and living expenses. This financial burden discourages doctoral engagement, contributes to low completion rates, and drives early-career researchers out of academia.

We argue that meaningful policy changes are needed to increase financial support, improve equity, and retain academic talent within the Spanish research system.
