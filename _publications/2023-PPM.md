## Exploring the Power of PPG Matrix for Atrial Fibrillation Detection with Integrated Explainability

**Published in**: [Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2024.108325)

### 🧠 Summary

This study introduces a novel explainable framework for atrial fibrillation (AF) detection using **Photoplethysmogram (PPG)** signals. The key innovation lies in converting PPG data into **PhotoplethysmoMatrices (PPMs)**—heatmap-like visualizations of aligned cardiac peaks—and applying a **CNN with attention modules** for classification.

---

### 🧪 Results

- Achieved **100% classification accuracy** across multiple experiments.
- Incorporated **attention mechanisms** for enhanced model interpretability.
- Showed robustness across variations in user counts and training sets.
- Highlighted spatial peak shifts as key indicators of AF.

---

### 📘 Why It Matters

- Offers **non-invasive, interpretable, and high-performing** AF detection.
- Bridges signal processing, image transformation, and **XAI for clinical diagnostics**.
- Suitable for future clinical integration due to simplicity and transparency.
