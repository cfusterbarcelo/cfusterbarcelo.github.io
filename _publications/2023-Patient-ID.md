Unleashing the Power of Electrocardiograms: A novel approach for Patient Identification in Healthcare Systems with ECG Signals

Over the course of the past two decades, a substantial body of research has substantiated the viability of utilising cardiac signals as a biometric modality. This paper presents a novel approach for patient identification in healthcare systems using electrocardiogram signals. A convolutional neural network is used to classify users based on images extracted from ECG signals. The proposed identification system is evaluated in multiple databases, providing a comprehensive understanding of its potential in real-world scenarios. The impact of Cardiovascular Diseases on generic user identification has been largely overlooked in previous studies. The presented method takes into account the cardiovascular condition of the patients, ensuring that the results obtained are not biased or limited. Furthermore, the results obtained are consistent and reliable, with lower error rates and higher accuracy metrics, as demonstrated through extensive experimentation. All these features make the proposed method a valuable contribution to the field of patient identification in healthcare systems, and make it a strong contender for practical applications.

This paper was submitted to the Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (JBHI) on February 2023. Is currently under review.
